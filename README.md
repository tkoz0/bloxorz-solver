# bloxorz-solver
compute a bloxorz solution with minimum moves possibile

Current progress:
- puzzle encodings are made, although I am not 100% certain there are zero
  mistakes
- code is messy and there are still a few features I'm trying to add

Tentative results:
- 1977 moves total is the minimum to complete the game
